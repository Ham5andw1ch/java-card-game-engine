# java-card-game-engine: A slow and painful descent into madness
Specifications and source code for a Java based lovecraftian horror.

Game rules are specified in a rules.<game>.txt file. The rules must specify the correct deck and board files to be used. The game engine will then dynamically create all necessary components to play the game, with game play following the rules file. See plugin/PluginKeyword for list of known Plugin keywords.

##Licensing
Ostensibly, the MIT license. In practice, one shouldn't need a license as that would imply you are reading the code. See LICENSE.txt.

##To Do
* Cry

##Complete
* Basic strutures built and tested (playing card, deck, cardpile, board)
* Reading and parsing plugin files using keywords
* Reading rules to create CardDealer - initially deal cards to piles
* Engine capable of reading conditions and performing actions
* Simple GUI created to test engine and show cards moving around
* Simple welome screen created to get choose a game and get player information
* Driver created to load the welcome GUI, create an engine, and load a main GUI
